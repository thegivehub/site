# Giving with Impact: How Donations Drive Real Change in Africa and South America

In Rwanda’s coffee-growing region, a $5,000 donation didn’t just purchase equipment—it transformed an entire community’s economic outlook. Two years later, the Gashonga Coffee Cooperative has tripled its income, sent 47 children to school, and funded a local health clinic. This is impact giving in action: donations strategically designed to create lasting, positive change across communities.
