we’ve prioritized building core infrastructure elements first. This
strategic decision was made to ensure a solid foundation before
launching to users:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Current Focus</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Smart contract development and testing on Stellar testnet</li>
<li>Campaign creation and management functionality</li>
<li>User account systems and security infrastructure</li>
<li>Website and content development</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Analytics Implementation Plan</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Analytics infrastructure will be built during our beta testing
phase</li>
<li>Initial focus will be on key metrics:
<ul>
<li>Campaign success rates</li>
<li>Donor retention</li>
<li>Fund distribution efficiency</li>
<li>Impact metric achievement rates</li>
<li>Geographic distribution of campaigns</li>
<li>User engagement patterns</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve planned this sequential approach to ensure that when we do
implement analytics, we’ll be measuring meaningful user interactions
rather than test data. This will provide more valuable insights for
optimizing the platform and demonstrating impact to stakeholders.</p>
