where we have legal bases for doing so.</p>
<p>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use

necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or
to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for

a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection

consent to us sending you our newsletter); or - we need to process your
data to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
<p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific
purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this
will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
<p>We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary.
While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially
acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized
access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. However, we advise
that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and
we cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain
your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or
to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another
person.</p>
<h3 id="collection-and-use-of-information">3. Collection and use of

<p>Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to
those in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party
engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy
