Subject: Excited to Support The Give Hub!

Hi Sis

I just wanted to say how incredibly proud I am of you for starting The Give Hub.   
It’s amazing to see you taking action to make the world a better place, and it’s   
truly inspiring. You’ve always had such a big heart, and now you’re channeling   
that energy into something that will create real change for so many communities.

I’m 100% onboard to support you as a celebrity spokesperson. This mission is   
something I’m happy to put my name behind, and I’ll do everything I can to help   
spread the word. What you’re doing aligns perfectly with my values and my belief   
in helping others rise up and succeed.

I also heard about the Stellar Development Foundation Community Grant you’re   
applying for. If you’re awarded the grant, you can count on me to match whatever   
funding they provide. Let’s make sure this project gets the resources it needs to   
thrive.

There’s still a lot we need to discuss—from how you’d like to use my endorsement  
to other ways I can get involved. Let’s schedule a time soon to chat through  
the details and figure out the best way for me to help you make this a success.

Love you lots and can’t wait to see where this goes. You’re doing something  
truly extraordinary, and I’m honored to be a part of it.

Talk soon,  
Fred
