Total Budget Request: $45,000

This structured approach:
1. Shows clear progression
2. Has realistic timeframes
3. Maintains reasonable costs
4. Focuses on core functionality first
5. Leaves room for future funding rounds

The budget is significantly reduced from the previous $148k request, making it more likely to be approved, while still providing enough resources to deliver a quality MVP and launch.
