# Small Donations, Big Change: How Microgiving is Empowering Remote Communities

A $5 donation from Seattle combined with €10 from Berlin and £8 from London – seemingly insignificant amounts individually, but together they just bought seeds for an entire farming cooperative in rural Mali. This is microgiving in action: the power of small donations creating massive collective impact in remote communities worldwide.
